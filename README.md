### FormData

- The FormData interface provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using the fetch() or XMLHttpRequest.send() method. It uses the same format a form would use if the encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".

- Using this Web API make's it very easy to interpolate a user's input into a data field for use as a query parameter for example.
